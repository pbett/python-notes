# python-notes
My own notes and snippets, giving some examples about how to do various pythony things. 

In particular, there's a focus on creating maps (using [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html)) and plotting data in them (using [iris](https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/index.html)).

I might add other things about plotting using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) more generally too.
